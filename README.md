# Landing as a Service Infrastructure

This repository contains a Terragrunt-based infrastructure setup for a serverless application that generates landing pages using AWS Bedrock. The infrastructure is organized under the `infrastructure/` directory with reusable Terraform modules and environment-specific configurations for `dev` and `prod` in `us-west-2`.

## Structure

```
infrastructure/
  modules/        # Reusable Terraform modules
  live/
    dev/          # Development environment
    prod/         # Production environment
```

Each environment deploys:
- S3 buckets for input HTML and generated output
- IAM roles for the Lambda function
- A Lambda function that calls Bedrock
- API Gateway for invoking the Lambda
- Cognito user pool for authentication
- CloudFront distribution to serve generated pages

Run `terragrunt run-all apply` from the desired environment directory to deploy.
